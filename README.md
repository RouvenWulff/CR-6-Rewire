## About

**CR-6 Rewire** is a personal modification project for the **Creality CR-6 SE** 3D printer.  
It is inspired by the **Voron Switchwire** and its derivative, the **Enderwire**, but adapted for the CR-6 SE platform.  

This is **not a full printer conversion**, but rather a collection of modifications and adaptations that reuse ideas and parts from the Switchwire/Enderwire projects.

Some components will be slightly modified or redesigned to fit the CR-6 SE.

## Motivation

This project is something I am doing **purely for myself and my sister** to create a functional and reliable printer.

**I cannot and will not invest a large amount of time into documentation, support, or development.**

However, since I am **using resources from the open-source community**, I want to give back by making my modifications available – even if only in a basic and incomplete form.  
That way, others may reuse or build upon them if they wish.

Big thanks to the **Voron Design team** and the **open-source 3D printing community** – without their work and willingness to share, this and many other projects would not exist.
