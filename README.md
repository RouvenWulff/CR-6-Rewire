## About

**CR-6 Rewire** is a personal modification project for the **Creality CR-6 SE** 3D printer.  
It is inspired by the **Voron Switchwire** and its derivative, the **Enderwire**, but adapted for the CR-6 SE platform.  

This is **not a full printer conversion**, but rather a collection of modifications and adaptations that reuse ideas and parts from the Switchwire/Enderwire projects.

Some components will be slightly modified or redesigned to fit the CR-6 SE.

**Toolhead:** This build uses the **Dragon Burner** toolhead by *chirpy2605* (originally for Voron V0), adapted/ported for the CR-6 SE.

This repository only contains the **files relevant to my specific modification**: parts configured for the **Phaetus Rapido** hotend in combination with the **Sherpa Mini** extruder. Other variants are intentionally omitted.

## Motivation

This project is something I am doing **purely for myself and my sister** to create a functional and reliable printer.

**I cannot and will not invest a large amount of time into documentation, support, or development.**

However, since I am **using resources from the open-source community**, I want to give back by making my modifications available – even if only in a basic and incomplete form.  
That way, others may reuse or build upon them if they wish.

## Work in Progress / Release Notes

I am publishing files **while I’m actively building the printer**. Not all parts or documents will be available at once, and designs may change as I test and iterate. The repository will be updated **incrementally!** If something is missing, it’s either not ready yet or still being validated. **Please re-check for updates** before printing critical parts.

## Acknowledgements

Big thanks to the **Voron Design team** and the **open-source 3D printing community** – without their work and willingness to share, this and many other projects would not exist.
